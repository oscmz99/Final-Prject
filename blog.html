                <h2>Human’s relationship with the universe</h2>
                <p>For as long as humans have been roaming the earth they’ve looked to the stars to wonder what is out there. They created heavenly beings to explain the world they lived in. Since the early days of civilization, they attempted to make sense of the skies they saw. No matter where humans were located something constant was the skies, and the skies themselves rarely changed.</p>
            
            <p>During the night, they saw patterns in the skies and they created stories behind the patterns they would see. Because these are the same skies we see, we’re able to see the same patterns they see and not only understand more about the cultures behind each civilization, we can understand our night sky better. We can have thousands and thousands of years of records and data. On top of that, we also have records for astronomical events such as comets and eclipses that can enable us to accurately predict their frequencies.</p>

            <p>Out of all the constellations and clusters that can be seen in the sky the most intriguing could be Pleiades, also known as the 7 Sisters. Pleiades is a group of 6 stars that appears during October and April. It can be seen near the constellation of Taurus. Many ancient civilizations have their own stories on the 7 Sisters, such as the Greeks and the native Australians who describe these stars as 7 girls who ascended to the skies. What’s intriguing about the cluster however is that despite it being called the 7 Sisters there are only 6 stars viewable to the naked eye. It’s thought that in the time when the stories were first derived that 2 of the stars merged to look like a single star.</p>

            <p>In ancient times many civilizations saw the day and night cycle as important. They created gods to portray the sun and moon. In almost every civilization, their sun gods were seen as all-powerful and had ungodly strength. What do solar eclipses have a play in this? Well, these people saw eclipses as harbingers of the apocalypse. In early history, there was no understanding of why the sun could be blocked out.</p>

            <p>Comets are shrouded in mystery. Even to this day, there’s still a lot about comets that we don’t know about. Just like solar eclipses, ancient civilizations thought comets were bad omens or harbingers of doom. As the sky was the main way people thought the gods would communicate with them they saw comets as a way for gods to let the people know they were going to get punished. The Romans attributed Caesar’s assassination to a comet, and the Incas blamed a comet for foreshadowing the Spanish conquest.</p>

            <p>It’s because of human curiosity about how the world works that we even reached the point of understanding that we are at. We can not only confirm that past events happened, we can even get an exact date to when certain events happened. And while we can also see that certain events did line up with the appearance of comets and eclipses, it’s only a coincidence that doom followed.</p>
